# dl_structured_data_hands_on
simplified repo for hands-on exercises related to Manning book [**Deep Learning with Structured Data**](https://www.manning.com/books/deep-learning-with-structured-data)

This is the code to accompany the [aigeeks](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=86EIoRlQgOE&list=PL5LkMeNlpwr_7JemkHQOcIGbfKSjn_Ngv&index=5&t=19s) session June 17, 2020 and the [Manning Twitch](https://www.twitch.tv/manningpublications) session Sept 1, 2020.

## Note
This repo is a subset of the full-blown repo for the book at https://github.com/ryanmark1867/deep_learning_for_structured_data

## Directory structure
- **data** - processed datasets and pickle files for intermediate datasets
- **models** - saved trained models
- **notebooks** - Jupyter notebooks **streetcar_model_training.ipynb** (deep learning model training) and **exercises_streetcar_model_training.ipynb** (exercise version of model training) along with associated class and config files
- **pipelines** - pickled pipeline files generated by **streetcar_model_training.ipynb**. 

## To exercise the code

**train deep learning model** - steps to train a deep learning model on the cleaned up dataset from the previous step. Output is a trained model (h5 file) and two pickle files for the pipeline 
1. update **notebooks/streetcar_model_training_config.yml** to specify input dataframe (pickled_dataframe). Set this to the filename of the dataframe output in the **prepare data** step
2. run **notebooks/streetcar_model_training.ipynb** in an env. with TensorFlow 2.0 installed

## Background

- **https://open.toronto.ca/dataset/ttc-streetcar-delay-data/** original dataset
- **https://www.kaggle.com/knowledgegrappler/a-simple-nn-solution-with-keras-0-48611-pl** Kaggle submission that was used as input to creation of the Keras model used in this example
